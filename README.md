# music-list-generator
THIS PROJECT IS'NT READY YET!

   Do you like when your favorite music is cut befor the end? Me neither.

   This project will allow you to play music for a fix duration, without having to cut the last music before the end. Very useful for studying, for exemple: you set a time limit, and the program will find a list of music to play. When the music stops, it's time to do something else!

# dependence
